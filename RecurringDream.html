Kaela is panting for her life but for these lives at the Techno Disruptor. Its a league of rebels that try to save everyone from the plans at A.C.U.T.E. A.C.U.T.E is a criminal organization that seems like an innocent organization but in reality its pure evil. Kaela hides a lot of people in a secret bunker. This bunker is  under her rug thats in her bedroom. Nearly everyone was there there hadn't been any casualties yet. She picked up speed dodging debris and direbots, the mad robots controlled by A.C.U.T.E. She had battled them and has some success. She saw that some were injured, so she called out for other troops to grab them and take them back to the bunker. 
Five other troopers and her continued to battle the bots. She saw the biggest robots yet. It had strucked with a load of ferocity and two of the troops had died. Before she could pummel the bot,it had almost got destroyed by another trooper. Kaela had ran up to the huge direbot and grabbed out its sparkly wires from inside of the huge robot. Thus ending the huge robot for real this time. 
However, one of the direbot had a enough strength to come back to life after being strucked by one of the troopers. It was able to pull out its gun and face it to Kaela killing her in an instant from behind. Shes a ghost now and saw herself laying faceless on the ground. She had realized she was gone. She tried swamming back into that body but she couldn't. She needs a new place to live inside. So she brought herself into the huge direbot.Thus making herself a huge direbot thats back to life. She had saved nearly everyone and she realized it would be hard for the people to destroy her new body. So she devised a plan. This plan was to get back at the community she lives in. This is because, all of them are selfish in wanting savior for themselves and would flinch to help others too. She felt like it was time to fix that problem. For this plan she would need a team a young strong team to help her.
