I also enjoy reading books. I am huge fan of murder mystery books. I really like this book called one of us is lying. The author of the book, Karen M McManus, is my favorite author. Karen's books all have a huge twist that occurs in the book.

<u>What I like the most about Annie Wright and My Favorite Subjects:</u>

</h2>

<p style="font-family: ariel;font-size:20px">

I like how Annie Wright is accepting to everyone for being who they are. I like how the teachers at this school are accepting to help support in what their students need. For instance like extended time for turning in assignments and so forth.
</p>
<p style="font-family:ariel;font-size:20px">

I like Math and Science the most in school. I like how you are either right or wrong there is no gray zone. I am currently,taking physics and though it can be challenging, I love solving the problems. The class I less like is English class. I really dislike how its your own interpertation and how you view things. I don't like how there is no right way or wrong way of view things.
