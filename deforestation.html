What is Deforestation?

<p>Deforestation is the action of the removal of trees.  Human action in which people cut down trees or other sorts of vegetation in the forests is one cause of deforestation. Wildfires can also be a cause of it too.  Wildfires have a negative impact on species in which their habitats can be lost in fires.

<h2> 
Why does deforestation affect animals?
</h2>
<div class="information">
<p> Animals that live out in the wild need a habitat that is suitable for them. This means areas where they are secure, comfortable and safe. These habitats are their homes which are used just like people use their homes. Animals also use them to escape predators. However, when their habitat or area is destroyed due to deforestation, animals lose their access to foods that were found in that area that was destroyed. This leads to animals exposed to more threats like predators. According to the stand for trees, “we lose around 137 species every day” because of deforestation.

<p> <strong>There is so many effects deforestion has on animals. Here basically all the effects on animals 
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Animals completely lose their homes.</li><p>
<br>
<li><p>A tree that is chopped down can also have a removal of the water and the food it is growing on it. For example “fruit-bearing trees” like apple trees.</p></li>
<br>
<li><p>It can also cause soil erosion as trees or any planet help prevent it but when it's good it increases soil erosion. This affects crops growing. Thus causing animals to have a harder time finding food.</p></li> 
<br>
<li><p>Animal species that lose their home also deal with an increase in competition. This also includes a higher increase in predators killing them, because they also lost their home too.</p></li> 
<br>
<p><strong>In general deforestation causes the population of animals to decrease and causes more and more animals to be extinct. </p>
</strong>
</ul>

<h2> The Effect of Deforestation on The Environment.

<p> Deforestation has also been shown to be one of the causes of global warming. This is because trees absorb and store carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. The carbon is chemically in the wood of trees. So when trees are burned the carbons is brought back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Since there is less and less trees they can't absorb the carbon dioxide. So the carbon dioxide accumulates in the atomosphere increasing global warming. This is because carbon dixide absorbs the heat in which earth had radiated of the planet.  More and more carbon dixide equals hotter and hotter temperature. According to the World Wildlife Fund forest loss causes around 10% of global warming. This in return, causes changes in weather world wide. Animals have a harder time maintaining their needs when climate changes. Animals are forced to migrate because of it.

<div class="information">
<p>
Asian pygmy and African elephants can grow to be at the most 11,000 pounds.  Even though they weigh a ton they are known to be the smallest elephants. They are in danger of having major competition with other forest elephants for homes they could live in. Pygmy elephants' homes are being turned into farms, etc. Lastly, their tusks are targeted by hunters. They are endangered, according to the trees there are only 30,000 pygmy elephants left.

<p>
The Sumatran rhinos is the most endangered rhinoceros species. Because of poaching and deforestation the numbers of sumatran rhinos has decreased by more than 70%. To this day there are only 80 sumatran rhinos left. Sumatran Rhino live in isolation making it harder to breed.</p>

The western chimpanzees that are found in west africa have decreased by over 80%. They  have a high risk of extinction. This is because of diseases, poachers and loss of habits due to deforestation. </p>

<p>Sloths are famous for how slow they are. However, the pygmy sloths (Pygmy Three-Toed sloths) are known to be exceptional swimmers. This species can be found off the coast of Panama on a small island and can’t be found anywhere else. Although not many people live there, fishers still trim down a tree called mangroves. They are cut down for charcoal and timber. Some Pygmy Sloths live in these mangroves and through this process they lose their home. There are estimated to be 100 pygmy sloths left in the wild.</p>

<p>These pandas live in forests in high up mountains, located in the south west part of China.  The rate of birth for pandas is really low.  This also includes them being hunted, and loss of home. This makes them more likely to become extinct. </p>
