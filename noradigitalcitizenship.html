Council of Europe says that digital citizenship can be shown as....

<p>“The competent and positive engagement with digital technologies (creating, working, sharing, socializing, investigating, playing, communicating, and learning); participating actively and responsibly (values, skills, attitudes, knowledge) in communities (local, national, global) at all levels (political, economic, social, cultural, and intercultural); being involved in a double process of lifelong learning (in formal, informal, and non-formal settings) and continuously defending human dignity”[4]. </p>
